# Setting Up Ubuntu Virtual Machine

To make our process as easy as possible to follow, we try to work in a linux envoronment.
Here is a guide to installing Ubuntu for you to use going forwards.

## Downloads

Go to [ubuntu.com](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop) and download the latest iso version.

Then go to [virtualbox.org](https://www.virtualbox.org/) and download the latest version. You may use VMware if you prefer that.

Once Virtual Box is downloaded go through the steps and install it.

## Step 1: Create a new Virtual Machine

Open Virtual Box

Click on "Machine" from the top toolbar, then click on "New".

Give a name to your virtual machine, then select the folder where you want to store it or keep it default. [(Figure 1)](figure1)

.
```

Allocate Memory size (Minimum: 2000MB, Recommended: 4000MB) [(Figure 2)](figure2)
```{figure} /images/figure2.png

height: 300px
name: figure2
---
.
```

Select "Create a Virtual Hard Disk"

Select VDI (Virtual Box Disk Image)

Select Dynamically allocated
For the size, at least 25GB is recommended

## Step 2: Selecting Ubuntu for the VM

Select your VM on the left side

On the top tab select Settings

Go to System > Processor, change it from 1 to 2 [(Figure 3)](figure3)
```{figure} /images/figure3.png

.
```

Now go to Storage and select the "Empty" CD icon [(Figure 4)](figure4)
```{figure} /images/figure4.png
---
height: 300px
name: figure4
---
.
```

On the right side, you will see another CD icon next to "IDE Secondary Master," select it then choose "Choose a disk file" then select the ISO you downloaded earlier. [(Figure 5)](figure5)
```{figure} /images/figure5.png

---
.
```

After that select "OK" then "Start" your VM

## Step 3: Installing Ubuntu

The installation process is pretty self-explanitory.
You are going to want to select "Install Ubuntu" on the first screen, then "Install third-party software for graphics ..." on the second, then "Install Now". You will have to fill out a form later, and then you are good to go.

It is recommended that you save a snapshot after Ubuntu is properly installed so you don't have to keep going through the process.
